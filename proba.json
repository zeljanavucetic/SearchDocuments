{"_id":{"$oid":"590069e307ba61cd2df14703"},"Content":"The Lebanese parliamentarian fears for his safety and information on his role in bombings in Syria is revealed in Al-Akhbar’s third installment of the report on the Sakr-Hariri tapes. These bombings killed dozens of civilians. As Hariri continues to delegate from afar, Saudi Arabia and Qatar intervene to block the release of Lebanese hostages in Syria.\r\nSaad Hariri’s relationship with the Syrian opposition – with those that adopt the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) in particular – dates back to 2005. And Okab Sakr was one of the first to open direct lines of communication between Hariri and the opposition.\r\nIn the beginning, when Sakr was still in Beirut, he managed “media coordination” and, at times, coordinated ground operations with Syrian opposition members. But the relationship remained in the shadows.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to an Al-Akhbar source, in 2011 Sakr had set up an operations room, with a staff of young Syrians and Lebanese, to coordinate with a similar group in Europe, and another in Syria.\r\nAlthough the protests had not yet spread far beyond Daraa, the Achrafieh-based war-room was transporting undetectable communications devices into Syria.\r\nHariri personally charged Sakr with the Syrian opposition file from the very start, and Sakr remained in charge after Hariri left Beirut.\r\nAs he took charge, Sakr began calling on the western-backed March 14 alliance to openly declare its position on the crisis in Syria.\r\nAnd he started to worry about his safety. When his personal computer in Beirut was hacked, he insisted on leaving the country. He discussed the issue with Hariri and [assassinated security chief] Brigadier Wissam al-Hassan.\r\nAfter consultations, Sakr moved to Belgium, planning to stay only a short while.\r\nAs he became more and more entangled with the Syrian opposition, however, and as Hariri remained abroad, he ended up living between Europe and Turkey.\r\nThen, the Saudis decided to support an armed Syrian opposition, and Okab started funneling weapons.\r\nThis is the story as it has been exposed by the Hariri-Sakr tapes, which were leaked by a former associate of Sakr’s to Al-Akhbar.\r\nThe source of the tapes says that a large number of armed Syrian opposition brigades were being partly financed by Sakr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe source said that Hariri and Sakr tried for the release of the abductees. But when Hariri's plane landed to take them home, Saudi and Qatar intervened to halt the effort.\r\nWhile the source insisted that the fate of the kidnapped pilgrims is not entirely in the hands of Sakr, as he is certain that the latter cannot go against orders from higher up.\r\nDespite rumors of collaboration, Sakr has always denied his role in arming the rebels.\r\nHe often dared people to prove his involvement. During a television appearance on Marcel Ghanem’s LBCI show, Sakr challenged, “If you can prove that I gave any of them a gun, I will go to court.”\r\nHe repeated his challenge on Paula Yacoubian’s show, on the Future news channel, declaring: “I stick to my words. Bring forth the evidence and take me to court.”\r\nIn yet another interview, this time in the al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, Sakr said, “Weapons are not our thing,” He asked how they could be sending weapons to Syria, that they did not even use in Lebanon.\r\n“We support the Syrian people with all our abilities, as instructed by [former] prime minister Saad Hariri,” he said. “And from day one,” he added: “I have not done anything without full consultation and direct orders from Saad Hariri.”\r\nSakr never revealed the secret behind his ability to negotiate with the armed groups, and he continued to deny his involvement in arming rebel Syrians.\r\nHe claimed that he was providing humanitarian support and that he went to Turkey to follow up on the abducted Lebanese citizens.\r\nHis top-level involvement is clear however, as he was even able to secure the release of the nine Iranians, kidnapped at the start of the Syrian uprising, by “calling in a favor.”\r\nIn today’s recording, Sakr receives a phone call from the Free Syrian Army’s (FSA) official spokesperson, Louai al-Mokdad.\r\nSakr asks Mokdad to stay on the line while he finishes with another call.\r\nHe tells the man on the other line that the battle will be settled. According to the source of the tape, they were discussing the battle of Maarat al-Numan.\r\nHe assures the caller that he is following up on the issue minute by minute, and that the region will not fall. He promises to keep him informed of every detail, and that he will not rest until the battle is won.\r\nSakr then appears to hang up with the other caller and go back to Mokdad.\r\nHe tells Mokdad that the situation is a mess.\r\nMokdad asks if the man on the other line was Saad Hariri; Sakr tells him that the latter is “going mad”, and that he had wanted to end the battle...\r\nThis article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.\r\nRecording Transcript: “Sheikh Saad Wants It Settled”\r\nLouai al-Mokdad: ‘Allo\r\nOkab Sakr: ‘Allo\r\nLM: Yes, Okab...\r\nOS: Yes, Louai, stay with me for a minute.

Believe me, he is not sleeping. He is following up moment by moment and second by second. And he wants to settle it in any way. He was saying, this has to be resolved specifically, and there is no space for failure.\r\nLM: Okab, there is a problem they are facing. Man, the region is falling and if it falls, there will be a domino effect. All the surrounding regions will fall. You know?\r\nOS: Man, I know it is. But I told you.

The civil organisations reacted to a draft published on the government website.

According to the Helsinki Committee, the legislation package would result in refugees being stripped of the possibility of social inclusion. It would also go against obligations to protect refugees stipulated by international, European and Hungarian law, the statement added.\r\nInstead of state support to help the integration of refugees and showing European Union solidarity, the draft only aims to motivate refugees to move on, shifting the responsibility to other countries, it added.

But what if you miss it on purpose?\r\nKathryn Hauer does that every single year. Married to her husband for 33 years, she is not hung up on the actual date. Feb. 14 may come and go, but the post-holiday bargains are just too good to pass up.\r\n“For us, it’s fiscally smart,” said the Aiken, South Carolina, financial planner. “As a gal who loves the after-holiday sales, I’m all for scooping up deals for my husband.”\r\nPlenty of other people are following suit, according to a new survey by financial comparison site Finder.com. Almost two in five Americans, or 39 percent, have celebrated their love after Valentine’s Day.\r\nWhat markups are they avoiding?\r\nAmericans are slated to spend $2 billion on flowers this Valentine’s Day, according to the National Retail Federation, with 35 percent of us ponying up for a bouquet.\r\nFlorists themselves pay more for stems during the mad scramble, and they pass the higher prices on to consumers.\r\nHotel rooms cost an average of 25 percent more on Valentine’s Day than the same day a week prior, according to a study by travel site Hipmunk.com. In popular spots like New York City, rates are more like 70 percent higher.\r\nAnd when it comes to that romantic dinner for two, 71 percent of Americans plan to go out on Valentine’s Day, and 44 percent order pricier menu selections than they normally would, according to a survey by reservation website OpenTable.com. On that day, reservations skyrocket by 520 percent, compared with a more typical day on the calendar.\r\nYounger Americans in particular are more amenable to a delayed Valentine’s Day, according to the Finder.com survey. Almost half of millennials (46 percent) have done so, compared with 36 percent of Generation X and 32 percent of baby boomers.\r\nJust beware that a postponed Valentine’s Day can be emotionally dangerous territory. A few tips on saving a few dollars while keeping your significant other:\r\n* Bring the idea up early\r\nWaiting until Feb. 13 to suggest a delay can seem thoughtless. If you mention the idea relatively early, then you are demonstrating that you are thinking about your partner and are putting some effort into logistics and planning. “Otherwise you could get yourself into some real trouble,” said Fred Schebesta, Finder.com’s founder and CEO.\r\n* Gauge your partner’s reaction\r\nHolidays mean different things to different people. If your partner likes to celebrate on Valentine’s Day itself, then drop the idea altogether. But if you sense flexibility and interest in saving some money, then bring up the option and offer veto power over it.\r\n* Take the length of the relationship into account\r\n“The newer the relationship, the less tolerance there is to celebrate love the day after,” advises Angel Melgoza, a financial planner in McAllen, Texas.\r\nIf you have been together for a long time, though, you may have more leeway to try something a little different.\r\n* Make it a bigger celebration\r\nOne way to sweeten the pot for a late Valentine’s Day: Instead of a muted midweek celebration (this year the holiday falls on a Tuesday), you can wait for a weekend.\r\n“If they just want to be treated more special than usual,” said financial planner Jon Powell of Rockville, Maryland, “make the case to delay your plans and have a bigger weekend together when prices are more reasonable.” (Reuters)","Title":"Saving by celebrating belated Valentine’s Day","entities":["Baby boomers","2000000000","Hipmunk.com","Logistics","Significant other","39","Husband","Generation X","Veto","Americans","Americans","Americans","Finder.com","Finder.com","Valentine's Day","Valentine's Day","Valentine's Day","Valentine's Day","Valentine's Day","Valentine's Day","Valentine's Day","70","71","Reuters","Valentine's Day","Retail","National Retail Federation","Kathryn Hauer","OpenTable.com","46","2017-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2017-06-27T00:00:00.000-04:00","520","44","32","Americans","25","13","33","36","35","1","14","Flower bouquet","Floristry","Valentine's Day","Menu","Rockville, Maryland","Maryland","McAllen, Texas","Flower","Millennials","Hotel","Finder.com","Angel Melgoza","Fred Schebesta","Jon Powell","Texas","South Carolina","Aiken, South Carolina","New York City"],"topics":["Q37587",null],"keyphrases":["plenty other people","dangerous territory","different things","few dollars","billion flowers","kathryn hauer","520 percent","founder and ceo","early waiting","five americans","average percent","new york city","few tips","fred schebesta finder.com","flexibility and interest","every single year","different people","muted midweek celebration","hotel rooms","late valentine day"],"analyzed":1}

While March 14 ostensibly played opposition politics within the confines of the law and the democratic process, it all the same focused its efforts on returning to what it believes is its rightful place in power.\r\nAlong its journey to reclaim power, March 14 made many uncalculated moves without realizing that the hands that it played, whether in politics or with the public opinion, would not be winning ones.\r\nBy the admission of several March 14 MPs and political figures, the alliance has received in 2012 some of its harshest blows since its inception in 2005, after its most important politician, former prime minister Saad Hariri, left the government headquarters – and the country – altogether.\r\nThe Numbers on the Street\r\n\r\n\r\nFigures in the opposition have acknowledged that Prime Minister Najib Mikati has performed admirably in office, forcing many international actors to recognize his government despite the attempts by the opposition to portray it as being subservient to Hezbollah and Iran.\r\nMarch 14 has realized that it has made many mistakes that cannot be mended at this stage. One of the most salient reasons that propelled this political alliance towards blundering in this fashion, lies in its debilitating financial crisis. For one thing, this meant that the movement could no longer supply its political pawns and allies with the financial equivalent of “performance enhancers.”\r\nThe leader of the Future Movement became preoccupied in his exile with the affairs of his inheritance, and his camp fell into a vicious cycle of internal crises. The stench of differences reeked from the March 14 camp, which calibrated all its moves to the pace of the conflict in Syria.\r\nImpact of the Assassination of Wissam al-Hassan\r\nIronically, the assassinations and assassination attempts against figures in the opposition provided the group opportunities to regroup and regain some lost sympathy. This started with the attempt on the life of Samir Geagea, the head of the Lebanese Forces, then with the attempt against MP Boutros Harb, until the unthinkable happened, when top security figure Maj. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, was assassinated.\r\nAfter Hassan’s assassination, March 14 thought that it had regained control and its ability to direct strikes as it pleased. But the reality was quite different, and the assassination of Hassan soon proved to be a fatal blow that took the political alliance out of the game.\r\nThe attempt to exploit Hassan’s assassination as a shortcut to returning to power also proved to be March 14’s biggest blunder yet. The reckless bid to storm the Grand Serail, or government headquarters, quickly squandered all solidarity that the Future Movement had managed to win.\nInstead of seeking to rectify its mistakes, the March 14 camp unleashed armed militants affiliated with the Future Movement in several areas of Beirut. This cost the movement a lot of political capital, and alarm bells sounded among its allies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the inflexibility shown by the opposition in pursuing the boycott, many MPs admit that this decision was made “out of spite.”\r\nSalafis and March 14\r\nIt seems that there is a political curse afflicting the March 14 alliance. To be sure, the emergence of extremist leaders such as Sheikh Ahmad al-Assir in Saida and the militant groups in Tripoli has embarrassed the opposition, which is otherwise keen on maintaining an image of moderation.\r\nIn the end, the constituents of March 14 saw no way out of this embarrassment other than to defend those extremists while pinning the blame on the faction in power.\r\nSome members of March 14 then turned their gazes to Syria. Here, the alliance was split into two camps, one that supports the Syrian revolution politically, with speeches and statements; and the other that has become engaged in the “jihadi” game. The Future Movement’s involvement in Syria is no longer a secret, as it has been disclosed by Saad Hariri himself, who said that what he has undertaken “a humanitarian duty towards the Syrian people.”\r\nHowever, Hariri’s involvement in Syria was not welcome news to many of his allies, who insist on the importance of adopting a neutral stance. Hariri’s involvement, through one of his most important deputies, MP Okab Sakr, in arming Syrian opposition groups is perhaps one of the biggest losses suffered by the March 14 alliance.\r\nThis article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.","Title":"Year in Review: The Highs and Lows of Lebanon’s March 14","entities":["Grand Serail","Lebanese Forces","Lebanon","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","Arabic Edition","Syrians","Syria","Arabic","Assassination","Sidon","Ahmed al-Assir","Boycott","Sheikh","Future Movement","Syria","Hassan","Democracy","Exile","Political alliance","Samir Geagea","Beirut","Future Movement","Future Movement","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","Hezbollah","Iran","Public opinion","Salafi movement","October 2012 Beirut bombing","Assassination","Syria","Syria","March 14 Alliance","Future Movement","Major general","Virtuous circle and vicious circle","Saad Hariri","Tripoli, Lebanon","Financial crisis","Prime minister","Boutros Harb","Allies of World War II","Hassan","Financial crisis","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","Assassination","Assassination","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","Assassination","March 14 Alliance","Saad Hariri","Saad Hariri","Saad Hariri","Prime minister","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","March 14 Alliance","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","Allies of World War II","Jihadism","Najib Mikati","Syria","Allies of World War II","Syria","Syria","Political alliance","Assassination","Syrian Civil War","Wissam al-Hassan","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","2018-03-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","Movement","Hassan","Movement","Movement","Syrian opposition","Okab Sakr","Syria","2012-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2012-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2005-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00"],"topics":["Q618331","Q1076300","Q3394438","Q822","Q7163","Q180684","Q7204","Q7188",null,"Q296771","Q858"],"keyphrases":["armed militants","hassan assassination shortcut","extremist leaders","2012 some","internal crises","financial crisis","difficult the opposition","many allies","ahmad al-assir saida","humanitarian duty","hariri involvement","image moderation","hariri involvement syria","hassan assassination","boutros harb","biggest blunder","extraordinary appetite","fatal blow","fond power","defeat 2012"],"analyzed":1}

The assumptions we made about our timelines, we have to re-look based upon the high casualties they took,” Nicholson said in his first interview since taking command of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan last month.\r\n“It wasn’t just the high casualties, which require replacement and retraining,” he said.\r\n“There was also the fact that they had to stop training and fight all year. So this put us behind on our projections in terms of the growth and increasing proficiency of the army and the police.”\r\nNicholson is about a third of the way through the 90-day assessment he will present in Washington some time in June.\r\nIt could be the most significant since General Stanley McChrystal recommended a “surge” in 2009 that took U.S. troop numbers to 100,000 and the overall NATO force to about 140,000.\r\nUnder the current timeline, the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan will fall from 9,800 at present to 5,500 by the start of 2017, barring a dramatic change of thinking in Washington.\r\nThe adherence to that timeline could be affected by the success of the mission to train Afghan soldiers and police, and to build a proficient air force to support them.\r\nNicholson would not be drawn on his recommendations for future troop levels.\r\nTaliban gains, including their brief capture of the key northern city of Kunduz last year, led his predecessor General John Campbell to recommend dropping plans to cut U.S. troop numbers from the start of 2016 and instead maintain the 9,800-strong force before a reduction by the start of next year.\r\nOriginally President Barack Obama had intended roughly to halve U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan this year and cut the force to just 1,000 troops based at the U.S. embassy in Kabul by the start of 2017.\r\nHEAVY LOSSES\r\nNicholson said Afghan forces suffered 5,500 killed in action and more than 14,000 wounded in 2015, significantly affecting the U.S.-led training and assistance mission.\r\n“This would be an enormous shock for any army, (including) a young army that is still growing. Yet they did not break,” Nicholson said, after touring Forward Operating Base Gamberi in eastern Laghman province, one of the four main training bases.\r\nA recent report from the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said it was unlikely that a “robust and sustainable” force would develop without a continuing strong U.S. and NATO presence.\r\nNicholson said that the heavy fighting of 2015 and casualties suffered by Afghan forces would be among the conditions NATO leaders would consider when deciding when to withdraw.\r\nNicholson added that “some more years” were needed to expand and train the fledgling Afghan air force now that U.S. and NATO aircraft take part in fewer operations. That effort in turn was affected by the heavy fighting in 2015.\r\n“The pilots that we’re training are going directly into combat. The combat affects the speed with which we can train and field the air force,” he said.\r\n“Until that airforce is fully fielded, the Afghans are at increased risk,” he said.\r\n(Additional reporting by James Mackenzie; Editing by Mike Collett-White)\r\nReuters\r\n","Title":"Fierce Afghan fighting slows NATO training mission- new US commander","entities":["2018-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2016-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2017-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2016-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2017-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2009-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","Afghan National Army","Air force","Afghan Air Force","United States","United States","Combat","Afghanistan","Air force","Afghanistan","Reconstruction Era","Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction","Laghman Province","Aircraft","Afghan National Army","Barack Obama","Air force","Afghanistan","Embassy of the United States, Kabul","Kabul","Mike Collett-White","Gamberi","James Mackenzie","Afghanistan","Air force","Afghanistan","Afghanistan","Afghanistan","Taliban","Soldier","Afghanistan","Afghanistan","Inspector general","John Nicholson","United States","Afghan National Army","Killed in action","Commanding officer","Afghanistan","2015-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2015-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2017-06-26T00:00:00.000-04:00","2017-06-01T00:00:00.000-04:00","90","United States","John Nicholson","United States","United States","John Nicholson","Combat","Afghanistan","John Nicholson","John Nicholson","Combat","John Nicholson","John Nicholson","United States Armed Forces","Instrument landing system","International Security Assistance Force","Afghanistan","Afghan National Army","John Campbell","Reuters","Kunduz","Paul Tait","Combat","Taliban","2017-06-01T00:00:00.000-04:00","Washington, D.C.","NATO","NATO","Reuters","NATO","NATO","NATO","Washington, D.C.","United States","United States","Forward operating base","Afghan National Army","United States","United States","United States","United States","Afghanistan","General Nicholson","2015-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2017-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2015-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2015-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","Washington, D.C.","Stanley A.

{"_id":{"$oid":"590069f907ba61cd2df14722"},"Content":"Recent clashes between Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and protesters have some wondering if the Islamist movement isn’t deploying more organized forces on the ground. Brotherhood members speak of “deterrence forces” that consist of the party’s younger corps, but many say that their goal is defense, not violence.\r\nCairo – After the January 25 revolution, many observers praised the role played by the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) youth in defending Tahrir Square during the famous “Battle of the Camel.” They were struck by the disciplined manner in which they operated at the time, something they attributed to the movement’s renowned organizational skills.\r\nExactly a year later, large numbers of MB members were deployed in front of the People’s Assembly to bar access to demonstrators, some of whom wanted to deliver the demands of “the revolution and the revolutionaries to the new MPs.”\r\nNow, many are questioning the true nature of the groups of MB supporters who were engaged in recent violent clashes, reviving long-standing accusations that the MB retains its own militias to use against opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Ismail Iskandarani, a political sociologist who was close to the MB in his youth, “The Brothers do not have militias, but they have makeshift formations which are labeled ‘deterrence.’ They used to be called on for self-defense during the days of election-time thuggery under Mubarak.”\r\nThe members of these “deterrence” forces are selected from working-class areas, and include MB members who play sports or practice martial arts.\r\nFor example, MB members at Alexandria University in the 1990s had a “deterrence force” that used to clash regularly with the university police. Its members included a well-known youth nicknamed “Tyson” and a martial arts expert called Ibrahim Kamal. Their main task was to force open gates that had been closed with chains, and to protect demonstrations from police crackdowns, he said. But they did not initiate violence.\r\nThe violence at Ittihadiya palace north of Cairo on 5 December 2012 was “a sectarian (in the factional sense) action prompted by a group of young men of a certain age and a certain build,” Iskandarani maintained. “It was militia-like behavior, but they are not militias.”\r\nR. Sh., a 27-year-old MB member who was close to the events of Ittihadiya Palace, disputed the “militia-like behavior” description, and maintained that the violence broke out spontaneously. He said that groups of MB supporters from Cairo had remained outside the palace for a long time debating, and sometimes exchanging harsh words, with the anti-MB protesters.\r\n“Then other young men from the provinces arrived. They saw the protesters’ tents and charged up to them chanting, and then wrecked them. One thing led to another. This made it necessary to form ad hoc deterrence groups on the spot from the people there. But that was not pre-planned,” he said.\r\nHe maintained that it was the use of live ammunition, pellets, and gas by people on the other side that provoked the Brotherhood youth into reacting violently against protesters.\r\n”Also, the fact that the police released some who had been arrested prompted the MB youth to shackle some and detain others – they felt they were between a hammer and an anvil.”\r\nHe added that the MB now has groups deployed near the palace to foil any bid to storm it, but that it has not deliberately used “deterrence groups” since the revolution, and has never employed them to intimidate political opponents.\r\nRights activist and former MB member Haitham Abu-Khalil concurred that the group does not retain “militias.” Even though “Qutbists” – a reference to Sayyid Qutub – are increasingly influential in its leadership, it is far from espousing such methods, he said.\r\nHe dismissed the notion that militia-like training takes place at the sports camps run by the MB, remarking that similar activities are undertaken by Coptic groups, sometimes in neighboring premises. Indeed, he remarked, the group has neglected sports and many other areas of activity of late since its leadership’s energies are now solely devoted to politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, deterrence groups – who would use things like flagpoles and solid wooden placards as “weapons” – were deployed at demonstrations to counter security forces, yet their participation was carefully organized and not spontaneous, according to Hassan.\r\nMohamed al-Barqouqi, secretary general of the youth wing of the Freedom and Justice and Party, the MB’s political arm, insisted that all the talk of the group maintaining ”deterrent forces” is exaggerated.\r\nAt the presidential palace, its supporters merely reacted to being attacked, as any other group would have done. During elections, “the MB have monitoring, publicity and vote-counting committees outside the voting centers, but there is no such thing as ‘deterrence’ committees,” he said.\r\n“The Brotherhood youth have not and will not use violence,” Barqouqi affirmed. “Otherwise, how come so many Brotherhood headquarters were stormed and so many of us died at Ittihadiya, and even then they didn’t retaliate? The Brotherhood leadership prohibits them from retaliating, even if these young peoples’ blood is boiling.”\r\nIskandarani, for his part, argued that these “deterrence groups” perform another function: channelling the pent-up energy and ideological zeal of its young members.\r\nThe 2007 parade was a case in point. “It was a carefully calculated display. The deterrence groups couldn’t overstep the red lies drawn by MB leaders outside the university, but they vented the anger of the youth who used to demonstrate mostly over regional and international issues and abuses against Muslims and Arabs, only to be subjected to repression by the Egyptian security forces.”\r\nThe problem now, as Iskandarani sees it, is that the MB still invokes the discourse of an oppressed party whose enemies are conspiring against it. Its leaders do not view themselves as being in power and as running the state through its established institutions. That is why the deterrence forces were summoned again last Wednesday, as a more obedient alternative to the yet-to-be-purged police, and to the politically scheming, if outwardly impartial, army.\r\nThis article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.","Title":"Egypt: Does the Muslim Brotherhood have “Militias”?","entities":["Violence","Battle of the Camel","Camel","Ammunition","Heliopolis Palace","Deterrence theory","Men of a Certain Age","Muslim","Justice","Sectarianism","Sayyid Qutb","Ad hoc","Tent","Anvil","Islamism","Arabic","Freedom","Barqouqi","Party","Arabic","Deterrence theory","Flag","Placard","Martial arts","Egypt","Cairo","Muslim Brotherhood","Sociology","Muslim","Political sociology","Egypt","Gas","Muslim","Muslim Brotherhood","Alexandria University","Copts","Tahrir Square","Self-defense","Ismail Iskandarani","Ittihadiya","Brotherhood","Arabic Edition","Alexandria","Mohamed al-Barqouqi","Ibrahim Kamal","Tyson","Haitham Abu-Khalil","Brothers","Hassan","R.

{"_id":{"$oid":"590069ff07ba61cd2df14728"},"Content":"Bangui, Central African Republic | AFP |\r\nPope Francis has brought fresh hopes of peace to the war-ravaged Central African Republic, with Christians and Muslims praising his decision to name Bangui’s archbishop a cardinal as a step to ending sectarian violence.\r\nAged only 49, Archbishop Dieudonne Nzapalainga will be the youngest of the 17 new “princes of the church” named by the pontiff Sunday, all of them his potential successors.\r\nNzapalainga, the archbishop of the capital of CAR, met the pope 11 months ago when Francis flew into the country torn by three years of sectarian violence for a visit that helped calm the trouble.\r\n“I was not named for myself, I was named for our country,” said Nzapalainga, who was instrumental in organising the pope’s potentially dangerous 2015 trip to one of the world’s poorest nations, where conflict has displaced more than one tenth of its 4.5 million people.\r\nAs if to underline the fresh impetus for peace offered by the pope, thousands of people poured onto the streets of Bangui late Sunday to celebrate their cardinal-to-be, with security staff forced to step in to usher the archbishop’s vehicle through the crowds to the cathedral.\r\n“It’s a new era, God is inviting us to make peace,” said Serge Makandjia, a member of the Catholic congregation.\r\nIn his evening sermon, Nzapalainga thanked the pope for his nomination, stressing that it comes as the country sees a new outbreak of violence.\r\n“I tell you that there is a God for the poor,” he said.\r\nSince the pontiff’s visit last year, the country has had elections that passed peacefully.\r\n– ‘Historic nomination’ –\r\nBut 100 days after his February election, President Faustin-Archange Touadera warned that CAR remains “in danger,” with entire regions controlled by armed groups representing warring pro-Christian and pro-Muslim militia.\r\nA 12,000-strong UN force is deployed in the country while France’s now reduced force of 350 is due to pull out this month.\r\nTensions remain high, however. Last week 11 people were killed and more than a dozen reported missing in violence that erupted after the slaying of an army commander in Bangui’s predominantly Muslim PK5 neighbourhood by an armed militia.\r\nNzapalainga pledged he would visit the PK5 neighbourhood “very rapidly” but residents were unable to leave the district to join the crowds celebrating in the streets.\r\n“We would’ve liked to have seen him, to have congratulated him but we couldn’t go out now that it’s dark in PK5,” Mariam Haidara told AFP by phone, from the Muslim-majority area.\r\nMuslim residents said they were proud of his nomination. “It’s the first time one of our countrymen will become a cardinal, it’s historic,” said Ahmat Kalil.\r\nImam Omar Kobine Layama, president of the Central African Islamic Community, too said the pope’s decision honoured the country as well as bolstered efforts by leaders of all religious denominations to set aside their differences in the interests of peace.\r\nCAR plunged into chaos after the March 2013 ousting of long-serving president Francois Bozize, a Christian, by the mainly Muslim Seleka rebel alliance.\r\nThe coup sparked revenge attacks involving Muslim forces and Christian vigilante groups known as “anti-balaka” (anti-machete) militias.\r\nThousands were slaughtered in the spiral of atrocities that followed, with the fears of a sectarian bloodbath leading to a military intervention by former colonial power France and the deployment of UN peacekeepers.\r\n","Title":"Pope’s new C.Africa cardinal brings fresh hope of peace","entities":["Christian","Muslim PK5","Dieudonne Nzapalainga","Faustin-Archange TouadÃ©ra","Ahmat Kalil","2013-03-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","Islam","Central African Islamic Community","Mariam Haidara","CAR","Sectarianism","Pope","350","Central African Republic","Muslim Seleka","2018-02-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","Omar Kobine Layama","Militia","France","Sectarianism","Sectarian violence","Prince of the Church","2017-06-25T00:00:00.000-04:00","2015-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","10","100","11","2016-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","Muslim","SÃ©lÃ©ka","Catholic","Agence France-Presse","Vigilante","Central African Republic","Muslim world","Imam","Bangui","Muslim","Sectarianism","Pope","Peacekeeping","Sermon","United Nations peacekeeping","United Nations","God","Christian","Islam","Ummah","Islam","Central African Republic","Rebel Alliance","Muslim","Invasion","Pope Francis","49","Prince","Outbreak","Pope","Dieudonne Nzapalainga","Pope","Central African Republic","Agence France-Presse","God","Bangui","Archbishop","Bangui","Dieudonne Nzapalainga","Militia","Pope","Archbishop","Pope Francis","Cardinal (Catholic Church)","Pope","Pope","Dieudonne Nzapalainga","United Nations","Sectarian violence","Bangui","Dieudonne Nzapalainga","Archbishop","France","Christian","Serge Makandjia","Religious denomination","11","2017-06-25T00:00:00.000-04:00","Coup d'Ã©tat","FranÃ§ois BozizÃ©","4.5","17","Cardinal (Catholic Church)","Bangui","Cathedral","Archbishop","Militia","Anti-balaka"],"topics":["Q7666027",null,"Q7163","Q180684","Q166542"],"keyphrases":["entire regions","ahmat kalil","force 350","colonial power","dark pk5 mariam haidara","all religious denominations","christian vigilante groups","12,000-strong force","fresh hopes","anti-balaka anti-machete militias","afp phone","cardinal historic","2015 trip","bangui archbishop cardinal step","evening sermon nzapalainga","100 days","archbishop dieudonne nzapalainga","efforts leaders","armed militia","armed groups"],"analyzed":1}

{"_id":{"$oid":"59006a0307ba61cd2df14732"},"Content":"Al-Akhbar’s reporters in Gaza examine the Palestinian military response to the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip. As the resistance fighters unify, they’ve been able to strike deeper into Israel.\r\nGaza – Tel Aviv’s stated objective behind its latest assault on Gaza is to enforce its policy of military deterrence in the Strip. After this objective was dealt a fatal blow by the Palestinian resistance, Israel presumed it would be able to end the battle at will – as it had always done – by reaching a truce that is often unilateral.\r\nThis time, however, Israel did not have its way. Instead, the fighters of the various factions of the Palestinian resistance have managed to strike deep into Israel using the latest weaponry. The resistance has continued to pound the occupied territories with a barrage of rockets, including the Fajr-5 missile, which was launched on Tel Aviv by Hamas’ military wing, the Izzedin al-Qassam Brigades.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe continued, “The brigades are ready to thwart any Israeli attempts to subjugate the Palestinian people, who have made countless sacrifices over the years for the sake of their freedom and independence.” He affirmed that there were various “means for self defense” at their disposal.\r\nMeanwhile, Abu Ataya, a spokesperson for the Popular Resistance Committees, said, “If the occupation continues its aggression on the Gaza Strip, then it must expect the worst and bear the consequences.”\r\n“The Israeli media are concealing the Israeli army’s casualties, a sign that the losses are indeed massive and that they would [otherwise] have a huge impact on the Zionist arena,” he said.\r\nThe resistance factions have announced that they are following a new strategy, one that will enhance joint military action and lead to more effective strikes against the enemy. The Palestinian resistance continues to deal surprising blows to the occupation forces.\r\nFirst, the Israeli army acknowledged that three of its soldiers were injured when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed in Eshkol in southern Israel.\r\nThen, Israel’s Channel 2 reported that a military plane went incommunicado over Gaza. This came after the Qassam Brigades declared that they had shot down an Israeli aircraft over the Strip.\r\nIn turn, Al-Quds Brigades confirmed that it had targeted Beersheba, Ofakim, and Ashdod with Grad rockets, and a military site in Sufa using 107 mm rockets.\r\nAccording to Channel 10, all Israeli hospitals were put on a high state of alert, while the Home Front Command in Israel made radio appeals for Israelis to go into the shelters immediately after they hear the sirens. Israeli Command told local authorities to prepare for a seven-week combat period.\r\nThree rockets also landed in the Tel Aviv area, while the Israeli army confirmed a rocket had fallen in an uninhabited stretch of land outside Jerusalem.\r\nLast night, Gaza was on the receiving end of some of the fiercest bombardment by Israel since the start of its assault. Hardly a minute went by without Israeli warplanes dropping bombs on the Strip. The explosions carry such force that they crack the ground open beneath them.\r\nSince Israel knows that a large part of the strength of Gaza and the resistance fighters is drawn from their sheer endurance and their ability to hold their ground, the occupation forces began making threats even before the military operation began.  Palestinians were thus warned that the latest war would be even more severe than Operation Cast Lead in late 2008.\r\nThis spread fear and panic among many residents of Gaza. It seemed that Israeli leaders, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wanted to start their assault by inflicting a psychological defeat upon the Gaza Strip first.\r\nTo be sure, it appears that Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip today have more control over their emotions, and know how to better deal with military escalation. During heavy bombardment, for example, they remain inside their homes and do not leave for any reason, even to help the injured.\r\nIn order to overcome the panic, many Palestinians banded together to keep each other posted of news in the early hours of the Israeli assault.\r\n\r\n\r\nMothers in Gaza have been playing their part too, trying to ease their children’s terror. Many have gathered their children in the safest place of their homes, away from windows, and read them stories that may give them strength and some reassurance.\r\nUm Mohammad al-Arami, 36, is a mother of four. She said that the previous night was the worst for her and her children. In the hope that they may forget the horror of the war and devastation around them, she made the children their favorite sweets. She also kept them away from the TV set.\r\n“I know we are in a war, but I am trying to keep it away from them,” she said. “They are still children, and I must not let them live these moments that may affect their psyches for many years to come.”\r\nUm Mohammad then added, “When I heard about the escalation that the occupation forces had first declared, I feared for my kids. I am now more reassured, and as the days go by, I feel that the escalation may end at any moment.”\r\nThe Israeli warplanes did not discourage Mohammad al-Sairafi, a child living in Gaza, from playing in the yard of his house, though he does steer clear of open spaces in case of an air raid.\r\nIn full confidence, Mohammad said, “Father told me that the Israelis are afraid of us, and that they don’t scare us. What’s more, a lot of the rockets are being fired from our side, not theirs. I know when the rockets are being fired from here, and I don’t stop playing when this happens. But when the rockets come from a plane, I try to be careful.”\r\nThe Palestinians in Gaza also found another place they can speak out against the war: Facebook. Many have taken to this social media service to share news, or sometimes, make jokes at the expense of the failed Israeli attack.\r\nMohammad al-Nakhaleh joked on his Facebook page: “The occupation said: Gaza is bombing us using the internationally banned white phosphorus!

Its staff lost their posts, but the PA kept them on its payroll nevertheless.\r\nHamas set up its own parallel administration with 50,000 staff, whose salaries the PA refuses to pay.\r\nAbbas is regularly accused in the Gaza Strip of abandoning its two million Palestinians, who have been battered by successive wars with Israel and crushing poverty and have been under a rigorous Israeli-Egyptian blockade for 10 years. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent arms smuggling.\r\nThe unemployment rate in the coastal territory is among the highest in the world, at 45 percent.\r\nThe wage cuts will have an impact beyond the civil servants themselves, as their purchasing power, Abu Ramadan said, is “the backbone of the Gaza economy.”\r\n“It’s a premeditated massacre,” said Aysha Abu Maghassib, who worked for the Palestinian Authority’s police.\r\nA widowed mother of two, she said that after deductions only about NIS 200 is left from this month’s wages.\r\nAmmar Al-Njjar, 33, demanded that Abbas resign, while Nevin Abu Herbid said she saw “a crisis erupting.”\r\nHamas called the cuts “arbitrary, inhumane and irresponsible.”\r\nEconomist Omar Shaban said they could be a Fatah tactic to weaken Hamas, its bitter rival, by creating a social crisis in the Strip.\r\nBut it has led Fatah members from Gaza to leave the party, with the east Gaza membership quitting as a group and individuals from the central and west Gaza districts also resigning.","Title":"Palestinian Authority pay cut angers Gaza workers","entities":["Budget","Blockade","Wage","Israeli new shekel","Hamas","Israel","Jawdat Abu Ramadan","Gaza Strip","Gaza Strip","Gaza Strip","Mahmoud Abbas","Mahmoud Abbas","Civil service","Purchasing power","Wage","Economist","Palestinian National Authority","Unemployment","Mahmoud Abbas","Economy of the State of Palestine","Agence France-Presse","Israeli new shekel","Israel","Palestinian National Authority","President of the Palestinian National Authority","Blockade","Blockade of the Gaza Strip","Poverty","200","33","2017-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","1300","465","2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","10","45","Jawdat Abu Ramadan","Palestinian National Authority","Palestinian National Authority","Gaza Strip","Civil service","Palestinian National Authority","Hamas","Palestinian National Authority","Palestinian National Authority","Palestinian National Authority","Israeli new shekel","Israeli new shekel","Fatah","Fatah","Palestinian National Authority","Islamic","Israeli-Egyptian","Fatah-dominated PA.

But in the end, they always fall. Always.”\r\n– Mahatma Gandhi\r\nSome two thousand people gathered in the Kossuth square on Sunday to protest a government proposal to turn Hungary into a police state every time Prime Minister Viktor Orbán cries wolf.\r\nAmong those attending the demonstration organized by Lajos Bokros’ Movement for a Modern Hungary (MOMA) were a number of former SZDSZ (Liberal Party) and MSZP (Socialist Party) politicians, including 1956 revolutionary hero Imre Mécs.  Several civil activists also showed up, including Sándor Mária, the so-called “nurse in black”.\r\nThe speakers, who included MOMA chairman Bokros and legal expert György Magyar, took turns denouncing government plans to modify the constitution for the sixth time since its adoption in 2011 so as to make it possible for the government to declare a state of emergency related to terrorism without consulting other branches of government.\r\nAndrea Katona, the former director of the National Széchényi Library, said that\r\n“We are living in a country in which a political group consisting of so many people passes laws which are not good for anyone apart from themselves.  They can do so because who dares to object. If you don’t climb into politics, then later politics will climb into you.\r\n“At present you are living a life in which you are afraid of everything,” Katona said. “You are afraid because you might lose your job, your flat, your existence, your family, your money, your physical well-being, even your life.  But there’s one thing you’re forgetting.  If you remain like this, you will lose your spine, and that grows back very slowly.  It is better, if you can, to lose your sense of self worth along with your spine, your pride and your ability to think, as well as the ancient sense of justice you were born with.  Only the fear remains!  For decades!” said the speaker.\r\n“When will they vote themselves the right of the first night, and when will the new feudal lords appear armored in orange sheepskin with the right of high justice?” he continued.\r\n“From the beginning Orbán has played the knight errant.  He sees imagined enemies everywhere and enjoys the role of defender of the country. And now he thinks that the time has come when he can introduce total dictatorship of one individual, and reign in a situation where not even the remaining, emasculated laws can obstruct him.\r\n“We are in the hands of a person who has mental problems. I know that in the days of old, primitive people respected those who were crazy, but they were not the ones leading the tribe. It shouldn’t be that way with us either!” Katona concluded her speech by quoting Gandhi:\r\n“Remember that all through history, there have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they seem invincible. But in the end, they always fall. Always.”\r\nAs in the case of previous demonstrations held in Kossuth tér, most of the protestors appeared to be in their 40s, 50s and 60s.","Title":"“We are in the hands of a person who has mental problems”","entities":["Kossuth tÃ©r","Alliance of Free Democrats","Protest","Constitution","High, middle and low justice","Hungary","Museum of Modern Art","State of emergency","Liberal Party (UK)","Activism","Knight-errant","Knight","Pride","2017-06-25T00:00:00.000-04:00","1956-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2011-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","SÃ¡ndor MÃ¡ria","GyÃ¶rgy Magyar","Andrea Katona","Separation of powers","Demonstration (protest)","Imre MÃ©cs","Defender (association football)","Tribe","Health","Droit du seigneur","Nursing","Sheepskin","Mahatma Gandhi","Lajos Bokros","Protest","Dictatorship","Modern Hungary Movement","Hungary","Self-concept","OrbÃ¡n","Mahatma Gandhi","Terrorism","Feudalism","Prime minister","Tyrant","Lajos Bokros","Andrea Katona","Museum of Modern Art","Andrea Katona","Police state","Viktor OrbÃ¡n","Self-esteem","Kossuth tÃ©r","Socialism","Hungarian Socialist Party","Hungarian Socialist Party","National SzÃ©chÃ©nyi Library","Library","Tyrant"],"topics":["Q753223","Q7163","Q7188","Q14934048","Q11042","Q7748"],"keyphrases":["many people","legal expert gyÃ¶rgy magyar","kossuth tÃ©r","government plans","moma chairman bokros","andrea katona","some two thousand people","living country","1956 revolutionary hero","imre mÃ©cs","armored orange sheepskin","police state","one individual","only the fear","government proposal","old primitive people","several civil activists","reign situation","other branches government","mental problems"],"analyzed":1}

{"_id":{"$oid":"59006a1107ba61cd2df1475b"},"Content":"Greek pensioner Dimitra says she never imagined a life reduced to food handouts: some rice, two bags of pasta, a packet of chickpeas, some dates and a tin of milk for the month.\r\nAt 73, Dimitra – who herself once helped the hard-up as a Red Cross food server – is among a growing number of Greeks barely getting by. After seven years of bailouts that poured billions of euros into their country, poverty isn’t getting any better; it’s getting worse like nowhere else in the EU.\r\n“It had never even crossed my mind,” she said, declining to give her last name because of the stigma still attached to accepting handouts in Greece. “I lived frugally. I’ve never even been on holiday. Nothing, nothing, nothing.”\r\nNow more than half of her 332 euro ($350) monthly income goes to renting a tiny Athens apartment. The rest: bills.\r\nThe global financial crisis and its fallout forced four euro zone countries to turn to international lenders. Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus all went through rescues and are back out, their economies growing again. But Greece, the first into a bailout in 2010, has needed three.\r\nRescue funds from the European Union and International Monetary Fund saved Greece from bankruptcy, but the austerity and reform policies the lenders attached as conditions have helped to turn recession into a depression.\r\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose leftist-led government is lagging in opinion polls, has tried to make the plight of Greeks a rallying cry in the latest round of drawn-out negotiations with the lenders blocking the release of more aid.\r\n“We must all be careful towards a country that has been pillaged and people who have made, and are continuing to make, so many sacrifices in the name of Europe,” he said this month.\r\nMuch of the vast sums in aid money has simply been in the form of new debt used to repay old borrowings. But regardless of who is to blame for the collapse in living standards, poverty figures from the EU statistics agency are startling.\r\nGreece isn’t the poorest member of the EU; poverty rates are higher in Bulgaria and Romania. But Greece isn’t far behind in third place, with Eurostat data showing 22.2 percent of the population were “severely materially deprived” in 2015.\r\nAnd whereas the figures have dropped sharply in the post-communist Balkan states – by almost a third in Romania’s case – the Greek rate has almost doubled since 2008, the year the global crisis erupted. Overall, the EU level fell from 8.5 percent to 8.1 percent over the period.\r\nTHE NEEDS ARE HUGE\r\nThe reality of such statistics becomes clear at places like the food bank run by the Athens municipality where Dimitra collects her monthly handouts.\r\nHere, dozens more Greeks waited solemnly with a ticket in hand to get their share. All are registered as living below the poverty line of about 370 euros a month.\r\n“The needs are huge,” said Eleni Katsouli, a municipal official in charge of the center.\r\nFigures for the food bank, which serves central Athens, show a similar trend on a local scale to the wider Eurostat data. About 11,000 families – or 26,000 people – are registered there, up from just 2,500 in 2012 and 6,000 in 2014, Katsouli said. About 5,000 are children.\r\nMany of the shelves and refrigerators in its stock room stood empty. What they give away depends on what sponsors – themselves often struggling businesses – can donate.\r\n“We’re worried because we don’t know if we’ll be able to meet these people’s needs,” Katsouli said. “There are families with young children and on some days we haven’t even got milk to give them.”\r\n‘WE JUST EXIST’\r\nInternational organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have urged the government to prioritize tackling poverty and inequality.\r\nUnemployment has slipped from a peak of 28 percent of the workforce to 23 percent but the rate remains the highest in the EU. Since the crisis began, the economy has shrunk by a quarter and thousands of businesses have closed for good.\r\nHopes are high the economy can pick up this year but data last week showed it contracted again from October to December after two straight quarters of growth.\r\nBetter living standards seem as far away as ever. Over 75 percent of households suffered a significant income reduction last year, a survey by business confederation GSEVEE and Marc pollsters found. A third had at least one unemployed member and 40 percent said they had to cut back on food spending.\r\nThe Greek Ombudsman says a growing number of people struggle to pay utility bills. In a no-frills Athens neighborhood, a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church serves 400 meals a day over four sittings in under two hours.\r\n“Everyone is going through hard times – all of Greece is,” said Eva Agkisalaki, 61, a former teacher who volunteers there.\r\nAgkisalaki did not qualify for a pension because her contract ended when the retirement age was lifted to 67 under the bailout program and she could not find work, she said. Part of her husband’s pension, cut to 600 euros from 980 also under reforms demanded by the international lenders, goes to her son and daughter’s families.\r\nIn return for volunteering, Agkisalaki receives handouts from the soup kitchen which she shares among her unemployed daughter and her son.\r\n“We’re vegetating,” she said between setting a long wooden table for the next meal of bean soup, bread, an egg, a slice of pizza and an apple. “We just exist. Most Greeks just exist.”\r\nEvangelia Konsta, who oversees the center and whose business supplies the meat, said the number of people eating at the soup kitchen has more than doubled in two years and the church often also helps cover people’s electricity or water bills too.\r\n“Things are getting worse, they’re not getting better and that’s reflected in people’s needs,” Konsta said. “There are people who haven’t even got 1 euro.”\r\nAcross Athens, the number of Greeks sleeping rough is a testament to that. Volunteers drive a van with two washing machines and two dryers to neighborhoods where the homeless gather to help them clean up.\r\n“You see the same faces, but also new ones,” said Fanis Tsonas, co-founder of the Ithaca mobile laundry, as destitute men and women brought bags of laundry.\r\nFew are hopeful of better days.\r\n“I don’t think there’s one person who’s not afraid of the future,” said Dimitra, the pensioner, clutching her plastic bag of rationed goods.","Title":"Greeks sink yet deeper in poverty","entities":["Homelessness","International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement","Rice","Greece","Social stigma","Loan","Loan","Loan","Greece","Soup","Kitchen","Washing machine","Euro","Money","Depression (economics)","Ireland","Soup","Tin","Loan","Clothes dryer","Income","European Union","Greece","Greece","Greece","Evangelia Konsta","Nothing","Nothing","Greece","Greece","Soup kitchen","Greece","Athens","Greece","Bailout","Milk","Unemployment","Eleni Katsouli","Greece","Eleni Katsouli","Bank run","Soup","Eastern Orthodox Church","Pension","2016-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","40","75","2017-12-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2","Soup kitchen","Food bank","Poverty","Eva Agkisalaki","Eva Agkisalaki","Bailout","Debt","Athens","Unemployment","Economic inequality","Poverty","Unemployment","Alexis Tsipras","Nothing","Romania","Dimitra","Workforce","Pizza","Chickpea","73","Dimitra","Soup kitchen","Kitchen","Bailout","European Union","Ombudsman","Financial crisis of 2007â€“2008","Euro","International Monetary Fund","Refrigerator","Athens","Eurostat","Athens","Income","Milk","Plastic bag","Soup","Kitchen","Poverty","Food bank","Meat","Standard of living","Pension","Laundry","2015-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","67","8.1","370","2008-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","980","Athens","7","332","22.2","4","2014-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","European Union","Poverty","European Union","Poverty","European Union","European Union","Laundry","Eurostat","Meal","Euro","Euro","Eurozone","400","Greece","61","23","350","2010-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2017-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","8.5","28","2012-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","Portugal","Bread","International","Dimitra","Ithaca","Fanis Tsonas","Evangelia Konsta","Eva Agkisalaki","Austerity","Bankruptcy","Romania","Greece","Dimitra","Greece","Standard of living","Marc","Pasta","Statistics","Cyprus","Prime minister","Meal","Opinion poll","Eleni Katsouli","Homelessness","Financial crisis of 2007â€“2008","Poverty","Balkans","Apartment","Poverty threshold","Euro","International organization","Electricity","1","600","Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development","Opinion poll","Bulgaria","European Union","Greece"],"topics":["Q41","Q10294","Q4916","Q41171","Q458","Q896666","Q312015","Q7163","Q43015","Q159810","Q113603"],"keyphrases":["packet chickpeas","food handouts","two bags","number greeks","greek pensioner","the number greeks"],"analyzed":1}

This is where liberal views and democratic views clash. Hungary is without doubt on the side of the democratic point of view.” – Viktor Orbán\r\nIn his regular Friday morning radio interview Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán took a number of rhetorical jabs at German Chancellor Angela Merkel, liberalism and NATO.\r\nIn response to a recent statement by Merkel, according to which if EU Member States try to solve EU problems on their own it will become that much more difficult for the EU to act in accordance with its shared values and interests, Orbán opined that “it’s better to act independently than to be idle together.”\r\nOn the migrants. Again.\r\n“There’s only one thing we can do here in Hungary: we will not welcome anyone into the country in an uncontrolled manner. Not terrorists. Not criminals. Not economic migrants. Not political refugees. No one will be allowed in the country in an uncontrolled manner. We will not allow for the kind of conditions that we see elsewhere to happen in Hungary. We will not have our fences broken through. We will not have rioting immigrants. We will not have refugee camps that are on fire. And we will not have all kinds of gangs preying on Hungarian women, our wives and daughters. This is impossible. This will never happen,” Orbán said.\r\n“We’re not going to turn Hungary into Europe. Hungary is a safe place,” the prime minister added.\r\nNATO\r\nOrbán dismissed a statement by NATO’s top commander, General Phillip Breedlove of the Supreme Allied Command Europe, that the mass bombing of civilian targets in Syria appears to serve no other purpose than to weaken Europe by creating a massive, and continuous, wave of people desperate for food, shelter, and safety.\r\nAs reported by Deutsche Welle, Breedlove also told the Senate Armed Services Committee that “[T]ogether, Russia and the Assad regime are deliberately weaponizing migration in an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve.”\r\nA self-proclaimed fan of Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, Orbán dismissed Breedlove’s statement as little more than a typical back-and-forth finger-pointing between two great powers, Russia and the United States.\r\nOn why Orbán refuses to acknowledge universal human rights\r\n“We need to ask whether a refugee policy is proper even if it goes against the will of a nation. Can we change the future of a nation, its demographic composition, its public safety, its cultural makeup, in the name of a higher abstract idea even if the people reject this? This is where liberalism and democracy clash. The liberals think that you should because society is not enlightened enough and values are not yet modern, and that is why it is the duty of leaders to force certain things even if they are against the will of the people. And then there are the democrats. We Hungarians fall into this category. We say that of course there can be debates about these kinds of things, but fundamental questions that shape the future of nations must be decided – not by the leaders – but by the people.\r\n“That is why you must ask the people. You must listen to them and accept their opinion and decision. This is where liberal views and democratic views clash.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59006a1607ba61cd2df1476e"},"Content":"Amid the uncertainty surrounding the health of 79-year-old Iraqi President Jalal Talabani following a recent stroke, many media reports circulated over the weekend concerning possible candidates for succession.\r\nAccording to the Kurdish media, leaders in Talabani’s party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), were divided over who would succeed Talabani as both party leader and president in the case of his death.\r\nThe speculation was limited to three names: Barham Salih, a leader in the PUK; Kosrat Rasul Ali, Talabani’s deputy in the PUK; and Hero Ibrahim Ahmad, Talabani’s wife and leader in the PUK.\r\nIraqi Kurdish sources close to Ahmad, such as the leader of the Kurdistan Progressive Party and Ahmad’s brother, claimed that Talabani and his wife’s family had agreed to nominate her to succeed him as president in the event that Talabani passes away. Yet other Kurdish sources said that the successors will ultimately boil down to either Barham Salih and Rasul Ali.\r\nThe independent newspaper The Voice of Kurdistan reported on 21 December 2012 that contacts were made with Nawshirwan Mustafa, general coordinator of the Movement for Change (MFC), and long-standing leaders in Talabani’s party, to head off the nomination of Barham Salih since the President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Massoud Barzani’s would reject Salih’s candidacy.\r\nThe newspaper’s sources added that in the event Ahmad is nominated for president, then Barzani would not object, despite the historic animosity between the Ahmad and Barzani families. Other sources were also quoted as saying that Barzani may nominate his son-in-law Nechirvan Barzani, the prime minister of the Kurdistan Region, for the post.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting sources in Sulaymaniyah described as being familiar with the inner workings of the PUK, the Kurdish media reported that the MFC, which had split from the PUK under the leadership of Nawshirwan Mustafa, is attempting to entice lower-level leaders from the PUK to join its ranks. The sources also hinted at the possibility of merging the PUK and the MFC should Talabani’s wife, who has family ties with the latter, succeed her husband as party leader.\r\nTalabani’s succession may also spark a new crisis, given the sharp polarization that marks the country’s political system. This may not be conducive to electing a consensus candidate, as was the case with President Talabani.\r\nArticle 70 of the Iraqi Constitution stipulates: “The Council of Representatives shall elect, from amongst the nominees, the President of the Republic by a two-thirds majority of its members (i.e. a majority of 218 members). If any of the candidates do not receive the required majority vote then the two candidates who received the highest number of votes shall compete and the one who receives the highest number of votes in the second election shall be declared as President.”\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the power-sharing system in Iraq, following the election of the first Council of Representatives in 2005, required for the president of the republic to be a Sunni Muslim, and to have two deputies: a Shia Muslim and an ethnic Kurd.\r\nBecause Talabani is Kurdish, his two deputies were a Sunni Muslim and a Shia Muslim, with a Shia prime minister – with two deputies, one Sunni and one Kurdish – and a Sunni Speaker – with two deputies, one Shia and a Kurd.\r\nIn addition to the intra-Kurdish struggle for the succession of Talabani, there is also another important factor: the desire of Sunni Arabs to restore control over the presidential post after it was stripped from them in 2004 with a new political power-sharing formula. Prior to 2004, the post was occupied by the Sunni Arab Ghazi al-Yawer.\r\nYawer went on to compete with veteran politician Adnan Pachachi over retaining the post, but the Shia-Kurdish alliance preferred Talabani over both Yawer and Pachachi. Some Iraqi media outlets reported that the prevailing attitude in the Sunni Arab community is that the Iraqi presidency should return to them in accordance with the sectarian power-sharing system.\r\nCertain circles in the Iraqiya coalition have proposed Speaker of Parliament Usama al-Nujayfi and Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq as potential presidential candidates.\r\nOther circles within the Iraqiya coalition do not wish to engage in a battle with the Kurdish parties, fearing that it could increase tensions at a time when the coalition is seeking to improve ties with the Kurdistan Region to counter the influence of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\n(Al-Akhbar)\r\nThis article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.","Title":"Iraqi President Still Alive as Succession Rumors Brew","entities":["Shia Islam","Saleh al-Mutlaq","President","Muslim","Kurds","Arabic","Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer","Iraqi National Movement","Shia Islam","Muslim","Kurds","Iraqi","2004-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2004-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2005-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","2012-12-21T00:00:00.000-05:00","218","70","MFC","Voice of Kurdistan","Stroke","Supermajority","President of France","Jalal Talabani","Sectarianism","Iraqi Kurdistan","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Prime minister","Nouri al-Maliki","Prophets and messengers in Islam","Prophets and messengers in Islam","Barham Salih","Barham Salih","Barham Salih","Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer","Kurds","Kurds","Kurds","Kurds","Kurds","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Jalal Talabani","Sunni Islam","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Prime minister","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Ibrahim Ahmad","Ibrahim Ahmad","Ibrahim Ahmad","Ibrahim Ahmad","Prime minister","President of France","MFC","MFC","Shia Islam","Sunni Islam","Adnan Pachachi","Nawshirwan Mustafa","Sunni Islam","Council of Representatives of Iraq","Iraqi Kurdistan","Masoud Barzani","Masoud Barzani","Masoud Barzani","Arabic","Shia Islam","President of France","President of France","Iraqi National Movement","Kurds","Iraqi","Iraqi","Shia-Kurdish","Iraq","Nechervan Barzani","Iraqi Kurdistan","Movement for Change","Polarization (waves)","Iraqi Kurdistan","Barham Salih","Adnan Pachachi","Arabic Edition","Speaker (politics)","Parliament","Sunni Islam","Iraqi Kurdistan","Arabic","Constitution of Iraq","President of Iraq","Patriotic Union of Kurdistan","Masoud Barzani","News media","Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer","Iraqi Kurdistan","Deputy prime minister","Prime minister","Iraqi Kurdistan","Kurds","Osama al-Nujaifi","Prophets and messengers in Islam","Muslim","Sunni Islam","President of France","Nawshirwan Mustafa","Sunni Islam","Arabic","President of Iraq","Plurality voting method","Council of Representatives of Iraq","Sunni Islam","Constitution","Sulaymaniyah","Muslim","Ibrahim Ahmad"],"topics":["Q677505","Q57306","Q1145192","Q41470","Q27293","Q12223","Q11767","Q7204","Q796","Q1154038","Q7163","Q7188","Q3394438","Q315927","Q7057435","Q205047",null,"Q1672351",null],"keyphrases":["kurdish two deputies","both party leader","december 2012","long-standing leaders","conducive electing consensus","new crisis","nawshirwan mustafa general coordinator","ethnic kurd","change mfc","certain circles","both yawer and pachachi","218 members","new political power-sharing formula","also another important factor","nechirvan barzani","family ties","lower-level leaders","iraqi kurdish sources","many media reports","barham salih"],"analyzed":1}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59006a1907ba61cd2df14772"},"Content":"TheFidesz-Christian-Democrat coalition, the opposition Jobbik and LMP parties supported an initiative to amend referendum rules. Last week, LMP resubmitted a proposal on referendum rules in light of a recent incident in which a group of thugs prevented a Socialist MP from submitting a referendum initiative to the National Election Office. The Socialists refused to attend the meeting, saying an investigation into the incident should come before cross-party talks, especially as the thugs were connected to Fidesz deputy leader Gábor Kubatov’s security firm.\r\nGergely Gulyás, who represented Fidesz-KDNP, said the National Election Office comprising members representing all parliamentary parties would hopefully put forward its amendment proposal soon. Gulyás said Fidesz-KDNP “was open to” discussing LMP’s proposals on amending referendum-related campaign financing rules and provisions on ensuring equal opportunities, but “would prefer to wait for the position to be formulated by the relevant body”.\r\nLMP’s co-leader András Schiffer said parliamentary parties must come up with a legal solution to ensure that incidents such as the one on February 23 do not occur again. He also called for broader changes to referendum rules.\n“Fidesz in 2011 created a referendum law that allowed those in power to play citizens as puppets, but we now want to have a law in place that truly returns the referendum to the people,” Schiffer said.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59006a1807ba61cd2df14770"},"Content":"Lebanese Future Movement  MP Okab Sakr accused Al-Akhbar of “forgery by editing” after the newspaper published parts of audio recordings that implicated him in providing arms to Syrian militants. To determine the recordings’ authenticity and whether there truly was “forgery by editing” requires an investigation by an independent and impartial party with specific technical qualifications. Following are some basic points to guide such an investigation.\r\nFirst: determining the identities of the voices in the recordings. Al-Akhbar compared the voices of the people with other authoritative recordings. By counting the vibrations in the sound waves, experts employed by Al-Akhbar concluded that the voice that appears in the recording matches Sakr’s voice. Indeed, Sakr confessed to this hours after the recordings were published.\r\nSecond: figuring out the recording tool used in order to determine the timing of the recordings. This is something that is supposed to be conducted by a party authorized to investigate this matter. The process requires looking for the people who did the recording and listening to their testimonies in order to obtain the used recording device.\r\nThe recording could have been made through one of the two phones used to make the call or through a third device connected to the phone network, either through a breached phone or the phone companies. The recording could also have been done by a device that was close to one of the callers, but was not directly connected to the line. It is also possible that the material consists of many recordings that were done in a different ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth: determining the nature of the copies of these recordings. Keep in mind that copies allow technicians to know when they were made and not when the original recordings were made. Therefore, it is impossible to determine, by technically examining the copies, when further parts of the recording were added to them. This process requires inspecting the recording device used to preserve the original recording, i.e., the memory chip or the CD or hard drive or any other tool to which the audio recordings were transferred before they were copied and distributed.\r\nFifth: In addition to determining the timing by checking either the original recording device or the device used to preserve the recording, it is technically possible to examine the sound waves throughout the recording that Sakr broadcast. There are differences between a voice recorded today and the same voice recorded yesterday or few hours earlier. These differences are very minor and an average listener might not notice them but they are visible on the screens of devices that analyze sound waves. Therefore, one can reveal any addition or subtraction or manipulation of the content by examining the recording broadcast by Sakr and distributed to the media.\r\nSakr claims that the recordings were stolen from him. But it is not clear whether the theft includes the original recording device or copies of the recordings. There is no doubt that the recording which Sakr said he filed in court is a copy. It is not possible to determine whether there were gaps in the timing of the entire recording unless it is technically examined.\r\nWithout such an investigation, this copy gives the impression that the recording is of specific conversations that took place over the phone at a specified time. Perhaps Sakr and his associates think that the investigating authorities will be satisfied with verifying the identity of the people whose voices appear in the recording and will not consider the question of possible variations in timing.\r\nThis article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.","Title":"If You Want to Know the Truth about the Recordings...","entities":["Sound","Syria","Arabic","Subtraction","Sound recording and reproduction","Forgery","Sound recording and reproduction","Subtraction","Okab Sakr","Al Akhbar (Lebanon)","Expert","Tool","Hard disk drive","Telephone","Subtraction","Forgery","Conversation","Vibration","Authentication","Future Movement","Lebanon","Arabic Edition","Compact disc","Okab Sakr","Okab Sakr","Okab Sakr","Okab Sakr","Okab Sakr","Okab Sakr","Okab Sakr","Sound","Sound","Al Akhbar (Lebanon)","Al Akhbar (Lebanon)","Telephone","Telephone","Telephone","Integrated circuit"],"topics":[],"keyphrases":["further parts","sound waves","forgery editing","al-akhbar forgery editing","fifth addition","perhaps (nnp sakr) and (nns associates)","court copy","audio recordings","syrian militants","few hours","specific technical qualifications","breached phone","not possible","the arabic edition","any other tool","any addition subtraction manipulation","possible variations timing","sakr broadcast","sakr voice","some basic points"],"analyzed":1}

According to the writ, Rahim was detained by the PA on September 29, 1995, and tortured to death.\r\nThe claimants accused Rajoub of playing a major role in the arrest, torture and death of their relative. The family testified that Rahim was visiting his home town of Ein Yabrud, near Ramallah, over 20 years ago, when plainclothes security forces detained him while he was playing backgammon in a local coffee house and took him to prison in Jericho. Two days later an ambulance delivered his dead body back to the town.\r\nThe ambulance driver allegedly told the family that Rahim died of a heart attack in the Jericho hospital. However the hospital told the family that Rahim was already dead when he arrived there.\r\nAn autopsy revealed injuries to Rahim’s head and face, broken teeth and cut lips, and cigarette burns all over his body. He also had broken ribs, but no heart damage.\r\nThe family claimed that Rahim was taken for ransom on the assumption that he was a rich American, and that when he refused to pay he was tortured to death.\r\nRahim left behind a wife and six children.\r\nRajoub is not likely to be detained or questioned by US authorities, according to the Ynet report, which added that the lawsuit was first filed 11 years ago but had been erased since Rajoub was not physically present in the US at the time.","Title":"Senior Fatah member hit with lawsuit upon arrival at JFK","entities":["Hospital","Injury","Myocardial infarction","Undercover operation","Azzam Rahim","Writ","Jericho","Ambulance","Ynet","United States","Autopsy","Ambulance","Emergency medical technician","2","Lawsuit","Ransom","Backgammon","Palestinian National Authority","Palestinian National Authority","PA Olympic","Prison","United States","Ynetnews","Cigarette","West Bank","Jibril Rajoub","Torture","Lawsuit","Azzam Rahim","Jibril Rajoub","Jibril Rajoub","Jibril Rajoub","New York City","Arrest","Jibril Rajoub","Writ","Jericho","250000000","Azzam Rahim","Azzam Rahim","Summons","Azzam Rahim","Torture","Azzam Rahim","Azzam Rahim","Palestinian National Authority","Azzam Rahim","Azzam Rahim","Jibril Rajoub","Torture","Fatah","Yabroud","Ein Yabrud","Ramallah","Palestinian Americans","11","Texas","Coffeehouse","Coffee","2017-06-28T00:00:00.000-04:00","1995-09-29T00:00:00.000-04:00","1995-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","20","2017-06-27T00:00:00.000-04:00","250000000","United States","Torture","John F.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59006a1d07ba61cd2df1477a"},"Content":"The looming Israeli threat to South Lebanon since liberation in 2000 has tended to keep big-time investors away from its alluring shore. But a different kind of grab for public coastal property has been underway from Saida to Tyre.\r\nFor some reason, the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation’s report on encroachments of public coastal property does not list all such cases along Lebanon’s southern shoreline. Many remain unmentioned, including a number of maritime landfills in the Saida district and summer houses and chalets that encroach on public property and violate construction regulations.\r\nTo cite one of many examples, a doctor close to a powerful family, Mohammad Shaheen, obtained the necessary political cover to build a house on the coast at Ras al-Shaq in Sarafand, circumventing municipal rules and regulations. He contracted the work to the Amal movement’s local head of social services, Ahmad al-Hajj, who found that he could make use of this cover too. He therefore built two houses, one for the doctor and one for himself, appropriating the beach, and going on to reclaim the sea, even chaining off a large area so they could dock small boats.\r\nThat’s how things are done in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the violations listed by the ministry for the southern coast are cases where people built houses or restaurants on small plots of coastal land under 500 m². This doesn’t preclude larger encroachments, but these are fewer in number, and some are overlooked in the report, such as the case of the Tyre Rest House, which has grown alarmingly and now extends far into the sea, disfiguring one of Lebanon’s best sandy beaches.\r\nThe ministry’s report counts 367 cases of encroachment in South Lebanon, covering around 468,973 m², 468,933 meters of which is reclaimed sea and only 40 m² of sea surface (a gross underestimate, as a quick Google tour of the southern coast will make clear).\r\nThe South stands out for having the largest area of buildings constructed on public coastal property than any other part of the country – covering a total of some 126,158 m². These are not counted in the total figures for encroachments, which include only reclaimed and enclosed sea surface areas.\r\nThe report also shows there were fewer permits issued in the South than any other region for individuals or entities to make use of public coastal property. These numbered only five, all in the Saida district. The total area of violated coastal property between Saida and Naqoura increases to 615,061 m², most of it reclaimed from the sea. All five licenses were issued to public sector bodies: two to the Saida municipality, and one each to Ghaziyeh municipality, the Fishermen’s Union, and the Saida Port Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nForty-eight of the encroachments, totaling 212,762 m² of landfill and 3,533 m² of buildings, are from neighboring property owners to whom decree 4810 does not apply. Thirty of the violations in this category involve houses and appropriating the beach.
